# To run all this project you need to install the python 3.8, because of the libraries and may need to update your pip to last version.

# If you just want to run without a virtual enviroment for the python libraries, you can jus do the following commands on the main folder:
```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### This will install all the libraries in your machine to run the code.

# Now if you want to configure one virtual enviroment for the python libraries, run the following commands:
```
  pip install virtualenv

  python -m venv env

  .\env\Scripts\activate.bat

  cd ../..

  pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### To run the code you have to click "Run" in the cell of Jupyter Notebook that I created.

# Have Fun :)
