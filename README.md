# If you just want to run without a virtual enviroment for the python libraries, you can jus do the following commands on the main folder:
```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### This will install all the libraries in your machine to run the code.

# Now if you want to configure one virtual enviroment for the python libraries, run the following commands:
```
  pip install virtualenv

  python venv -m env

  .\venv\Scripts\activate.bat

  cd ../..

  pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### To run the code you have to clic "Run" in the cell of Jupyter Notebook that I created.

# Have Fun :)
